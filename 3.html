<h3> the best investment </h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-investments/" target="_blank" title="invest tip">By far the <strong>best investment</strong></a> you can make is in yourself
If you invest <u>yourself</u>. nobody can take it away from you</p>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">If i gave you a car and it would be a only car you'd get for the rest of your life.
You'd take care of it like you can't believe
That if you'd scratch it. You'd fix it in that very moment.
You'd read the owner's menual.<br><br><br><img src="invest copy.jpg" width="50%"></p> You'd keep it in garage and do all these things.
You get exactly one body and one mind in this world.
You can't start taking care of it when you're 50
If you'd remember that you just got one mind and body to get through life with it.
Now the most important thing is really who you associate with.





the best investment you can make is in <strong>yourself</strong>
